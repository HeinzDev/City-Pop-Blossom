## 🌸 Welcome to City Pop Blossom! 🌸

This is a personal project focused on learning Javascript that aims to provide a music player platform inspired by the city pop music genre. The idea of the project came from an site that allows users to discover new songs for an especific genre of music.

## Song Manager
To facilitate the addition and removal of actual songs, a shell script named music-manager.sh is included in the project (The song file needs to be in the project directory to be added). This allows for new songs to be easily added to the site and old songs to be removed.

## Copyright
The site is completely free and does not hold the rights to any of the songs or artwork used, and the songs chosen to illustrate the site are just samples since i dont't own any of the real songs.
